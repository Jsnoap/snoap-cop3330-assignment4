        This test will test the ability of the App to mark a created task as complete.
        This will be done by creating a task with a status of "Uncompleted".
        Then the associated functions of calling the button to mark as completed/uncompleted will be called
        to change the status of the task to "Completed".
        This should return a boolean value of "true" when the task is marked as completed, so this
        will be tested and if it is "true", the test will pass.
